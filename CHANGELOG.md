# Changelog

## [2.7.33] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Snapshot restore no longer re-runs prior turn when user issues a new leader request** — v2.7.32 field log 2026-04-22 showed grace correctly dropped 2 scrollback directives (`apple` / `1부터 10까지`), but the moment the user typed a NEW leader request (`worker-1한테는 바나나... worker-2는 1부터 5까지`), Claude's Ink UI repainted the alt-screen — which still contains the PREVIOUS assistant turn above the input box — and the repaint stream re-emitted the old `@worker-N:` directives to the parser. Dedupe didn't catch them (they had been dropped, not routed, so `recentPayloads` had no record), so they queued behind the new directives and re-executed once workers went idle.

  Log sequence reproducing:
  ```
  [orch.restoreGrace] window closed (deadline) — dropped 2 directive(s)
  [parser yielded 2 msg(s)] banana, 1-to-5   (user's new turn)
  [orch] → worker-1: banana
  [orch] → worker-2: 1부터 5
  [parser yielded 4 msg(s)] apple, 1-to-10, banana, 1-to-5   (Ink redraw)
  [orch] queue worker-1 (busy, queue=1): "apple"   ← re-execution
  [orch] queue worker-2 (busy, queue=1): 1부터 10
  ```

  Fix: when `restoreGrace` drops a parser-yielded directive, also seed the target worker's `recentPayloads` dedupe cache with that payload at the current timestamp. `commitRoute` already consults `recentPayloads` and returns early with `stats.deduped += 1` when a match is found within `dedupeWindowMs`. Defaults give ≥15s of post-grace-close dedupe coverage (dedupe window 30_000 ms - grace window 15_000 ms = 15 s), which is well beyond the typical delay between restore and the first user-triggered Ink redraw.

### Internal
- `PodiumOrchestrator.route()` in [PodiumOrchestrator.ts](src/orchestration/core/PodiumOrchestrator.ts) — inside the `restoreGraceEndsAt !== null` branch, after logging the drop, look up the target worker and, if present, call `w.recentPayloads.set(msg.payload, this.nowFn())`. No other state paths touched.
- Grace drops still only count into `stats.dropped`; the new dedupe seed does NOT increment `stats.deduped` (that counter only fires on actual `commitRoute` dedupe hits).

### Tests
- New v2.7.33 regression test `grace-dropped directives are seeded into dedupe cache; post-close Ink redraws do NOT re-route`: arm grace (1 s), fire scrollback chunk → assert `dropped=2`; advance 1100 ms → assert grace closed via `(deadline)`; fire the SAME scrollback chunk again (simulating Ink's post-close repaint) → assert `injected`/`queued` unchanged, `deduped` increased by 2, and no `[orch] queue worker-N (busy...)` log lines appeared.
- 142/142 pass (141 prior + 1 new).

## [2.7.32] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Snapshot restore grace no longer closes prematurely during Claude CLI's post-spawn welcome UI** — v2.7.31 field log on 2026-04-22 showed the regression was still live: `[orch.restoreGrace] window closed (leader-idle) — dropped 0` still fired before the scrollback `● @worker-N:` burst arrived, and both workers re-executed the prior turn's directives.

  Root cause of the v2.7.31 failure: `IdleDetector.hasPromptPattern()` matches `>`, `[OMC#x.y.z] |`, `⏵⏵ bypass permissions on`, and `╰──` rows in the rolling tail. Claude CLI v2.1+ paints those rows as part of its **initial welcome screen** — immediately on spawn, BEFORE `--resume` starts loading the session and long before scrollback replay begins. So `hasPromptPattern()` returns true from t=0, and `isIdle` fires as soon as the welcome banner finishes printing (~500 ms). v2.7.31's "prompt + silence" gate was no better than v2.7.29's raw silence; both sit entirely in the pre-replay window.

  Conclusion: **no leader-side signal reliably marks "scrollback replay finished."** The prompt pattern exists before replay starts, silence exists before replay starts, and the replayed `● @worker-N:` bullets are indistinguishable from a live leader response.

  Fix: remove the idle-gate entirely. Grace now closes **only when the wall-clock deadline expires** (`restoreGraceMs`, default 15000 ms unchanged from v2.7.29). During the full window, ALL parser-yielded directives are dropped with `[orch.restoreGrace] dropped routing to "<worker>": ...`. Tradeoff: anything the user types in the first 15 s after restore also gets dropped. Acceptable because (a) restore UX has a natural settle pause, (b) re-execution of prior turns is a much worse bug, (c) `restoreGraceMs` is configurable via the attach option for callers that can guarantee an earlier quiescent point.

### Internal
- `PodiumOrchestrator.tick()` in [PodiumOrchestrator.ts](src/orchestration/core/PodiumOrchestrator.ts) — grace close condition simplified to `this.nowFn() >= this.restoreGraceEndsAt`. The `leaderIdle.isIdle` check and the `reason` branch (`leader-idle` vs `deadline`) are gone; close log always reads `window closed (deadline)`.
- No changes to `leaderIdle` itself — still used for parser-flush-on-idle elsewhere in tick(). Only the grace path stopped consuming it.
- State fields unchanged: `restoreGraceEndsAt`, `restoreGraceDroppedCount`.

### Tests
- Removed `v2.7.31: grace closes via leader-idle gate (prompt pattern + silence)` and `v2.7.31: grace stays open during post-spawn silence before any leader output` — both encoded the broken idle-gate contract.
- Added v2.7.32 `grace holds through leader silence + prompt pattern until wall-clock deadline`: feeds a realistic Claude welcome row (`>`, `[OMC#...]`, `⏵⏵ bypass permissions on`), advances 10 s of silence, verifies grace does NOT close; then fires scrollback directive (verified dropped), advances past the 15 s deadline, verifies close log reads `(deadline)`.
- Renamed previous v2.7.29 deadline test to v2.7.32 (`closes via wall-clock deadline even when leader is actively emitting`); comment updated to reflect single-path close.
- 141/141 pass (142 prior - 2 deleted + 1 new = 141).

### Known tradeoff
- The first `restoreGraceMs` (15 s default) after restore drops any `@worker-N:` directive the leader emits — INCLUDING ones the user typed live. Don't type directives immediately after restore; wait for `[orch.restoreGrace] window closed (deadline)` in the orchestration output channel.

## [2.7.31] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Snapshot restore grace no longer closes during Claude CLI's post-spawn loading silence** — v2.7.30 field test on 2026-04-22: after `Open Saved Team...`, workers **re-executed the prior `"apple"을 한글로 번역해줘.` / `1부터 10까지 합` directives** replayed from scrollback, even though `[orch.restoreGrace] armed for 15000ms` logged correctly. The close message fired **before** the scrollback burst arrived: `[orch.restoreGrace] window closed (leader-idle) — dropped 0 directive(s)` came out, **then** `[orch.trace] parser yielded 2 msg(s)` routed them live.

  Root cause: v2.7.29's idle-gate compared raw `leaderIdle.msSinceOutput >= 1000ms`. But `IdleDetector.lastOutputAt` is seeded at `this.now()` at construction time, so `msSinceOutput` grows monotonically from zero **even when the leader has never emitted a single byte**. Claude CLI's `--resume` takes >1s to load the session from disk before printing the scrollback burst, so the 1s silence threshold was easily crossed during the loading gap. Grace closed with `dropped 0`, scrollback replay routed live, workers re-executed.

  Fix: gate on `leaderIdle.isIdle` instead of raw silence. `isIdle` requires BOTH silence (≥500ms) AND a recognized prompt pattern in the rolling tail (`>`, `[OMC#...]`, `╰──`, or older boxed variants). Claude paints the prompt box only at the END of scrollback replay, so `hasPromptPattern()` can't return true during the loading gap or mid-replay — no more premature close.

### Internal
- `PodiumOrchestrator.tick()` in [PodiumOrchestrator.ts](src/orchestration/core/PodiumOrchestrator.ts) — the grace idle-gate now reads `this.leaderIdle.isIdle` (public getter on `IdleDetector`) instead of `leaderIdle.msSinceOutput >= RESTORE_GRACE_IDLE_MS`. Deadline path (`this.nowFn() >= this.restoreGraceEndsAt`) unchanged — still the 15s safety cap.
- `RESTORE_GRACE_IDLE_MS = 1000` constant removed (no longer referenced; `isIdle` uses `IdleDetector.silenceMs = 500` from construction).
- No new state fields. `restoreGraceEndsAt`, `restoreGraceDroppedCount` unchanged.

### Tests
- v2.7.29 test `grace closes via leader-idle gate (1s silence after burst)` rewritten as v2.7.31 `grace closes via leader-idle gate (prompt pattern + silence)`: burst `● @worker-1: replayed-1` without prompt → verify grace stays open → then emit cosmetic `>` + `[OMC#...]` prompt row → verify grace closes via `leader-idle` reason.
- New v2.7.31 regression test `grace stays open during post-spawn silence before any leader output`: attach → advance 5s of wall-clock silence with no leader output → verify grace does NOT close (pre-v2.7.31 would close at t≈1s with `dropped 0`) → then simulate late-arriving scrollback + prompt → verify grace finally closes.
- v2.7.29 deadline test unchanged (continuous emission without prompt pattern → idle never fires → deadline trips).
- 142/142 pass (141 prior + 1 net new).

## [2.7.30] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Claude assistant projector no longer closes the block on Ink UI repaints** — v2.7.29 field test showed `worker-1` receiving no directive even though the leader's response visibly ended with `@worker-1: 안녕?`. Output log showed `[orch.trace] leader @worker chunk suppressed by Claude assistant projector` for the legitimate directive. Root cause: Claude Code v2.1+'s Ink TUI continuously repaints the bottom input-box prompt (`> @worker-1: 안녕?<padding>`), the `[OMC#...]` status row, and `────` box-chrome into the same PTY stream as the streaming assistant response. The v2.7.6-era projector classified those three line kinds as "non-assistant" and closed `inAssistantBlock`. When leader's response was long enough for Ink to sneak a repaint between the `●` bullet and a later continuation row (common for multi-sentence responses with a blank line), the assistant block closed prematurely and the continuation `@worker-N:` directive was stripped silently.

  Fix: `prompt` / `status` / `chrome` lines are still dropped from the projector's output (they never route), but they no longer close the block. Only genuinely unknown `other` content — i.e. model output that doesn't match any recognized UI element — marks the assistant turn as ended. `assistant-start` (`●` bullet) still opens/re-opens the block as before.

### Internal
- `ClaudeLeaderRoutingProjector.processLine` in [messageRouter.ts](src/orchestration/core/messageRouter.ts) — the `this.inAssistantBlock = false` sink now sits behind a `kind === 'other'` check. Pre-fix, any of {`prompt`, `status`, `chrome`, `other`} closed the block; post-fix, only `other` does. No state-machine shape change; no new fields.

### Tests
- 2 new cases in [test/unit/messageRouter.test.ts](test/unit/messageRouter.test.ts):
  - `projector: Ink input-box repaint mid-stream does not close assistant block (v2.7.30)` — reproduces the exact v2.7.29 failure (assistant bullet → cont line → blank → `> @worker-1: 안녕?<padding>` repaint → `  @worker-1: 안녕?` cont). Pre-fix the post-repaint cont was stripped; post-fix it survives.
  - `projector: status/chrome mid-stream also does not close assistant block (v2.7.30)` — similar but with `[OMC#...]`, `────`, and `⏵⏵ bypass permissions` interleaved.
- All 141/141 pass (139 prior + 2 new).

## [2.7.29] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Snapshot restore grace window is now idle-gated, not wall-clock** — v2.7.28 used a flat 3-second deadline on the restore grace window, intending to drop routing directives replayed from the leader's `--resume` scrollback. A user report on 2026-04-22 showed the window closing while Claude CLI was still repainting the prior assistant turn (scrollback + full `● Podium 팀 프로토콜 ... @worker-1: 안녕?` re-render takes >3s for a non-trivial session). The first parsed directive sailed past the (already-expired) window with `dropped 0 directive(s)` logged — and `worker-1` re-executed the replayed `안녕?` directive even though the user never typed a new one.

  Grace is now held open while `leaderIdle.msSinceOutput < 1000` (leader has emitted output in the last 1s — indicating Ink is still mid-repaint). Grace closes as soon as the leader stays quiet for 1s (replay settled) OR the wall-clock safety cap (15s default, bumped from 3s) fires. Normal restores close via the idle gate in 2–4s; the safety cap only trips for a hung leader. `[orch.restoreGrace] window closed (leader-idle)` vs `window closed (deadline)` shows which path fired.

### Internal
- New `RESTORE_GRACE_IDLE_MS = 1000` module constant alongside `ADD_WORKER_RACE_WINDOW_MS`.
- `PodiumOrchestrator.route()` grace branch now reads `this.leaderIdle.msSinceOutput` instead of comparing only `nowFn()` vs `restoreGraceEndsAt`. Still falls back to the wall-clock deadline when `leaderIdle` is unset (fresh-orchestrate path that never sets `restoreGraceEndsAt` — unchanged cost).
- `index.ts` snapshot.load handler's `restoreGraceMs` bumped `3000 → 15000` (safety cap, not the expected close time).

### Tests
- 2 new cases in `podiumOrchestratorWorkerMgmt.test.ts`: directive dropped while leader emits within 1s; directive routed once leader stays silent for 1s+. Existing v2.7.28 test (grace=0 disarm) unchanged.

## [2.7.28] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Snapshot restore no longer re-executes prior-session routing directives** — During v2.7.27 verification, after `Open Saved Team...` restored a team and the user observed that `worker-1` answered the restored `안녕?` question **a second time** even though no new directive had been typed. Root cause: `--resume <uuid>` causes Claude CLI to replay its prior conversation into the alt-screen scrollback on leader spawn. As Ink repaints that scrollback, its pty stream contains the same `@worker-N: ...` directives that were already routed+executed in the original session. The freshly-attached orchestrator (empty `recentPayloads` Map, no dedupe state carried over) treats them as new directives and re-injects them into the just-restored worker panes, duplicating every prior command.

  Restore now arms a **3-second grace window** (`OrchestratorAttachOptions.restoreGraceMs: 3000`) inside `PodiumOrchestrator.route()`. Any routing directive parsed during the window is dropped with `[orch.restoreGrace] dropped routing to "worker-N" (Nms left in grace): <payload>` and a summary `[orch.restoreGrace] window closed — dropped N directive(s) from scrollback replay; live routing active` fires when the window expires. Fresh orchestrate (no `--resume`) omits the option and the code path is zero-cost.

  The window only affects parser → route dispatch. IdleDetector feeds, transcript accumulation, leader-notify commits, and snapshot auto-save continue to see the replayed bytes so idle detection and autosave behavior stay correct.

### Internal
- `PodiumOrchestrator.attach()` gains the `restoreGraceMs` option. Stored as `restoreGraceEndsAt` (nowFn-relative deadline) + `restoreGraceDroppedCount` (for the closing summary log). Both null/zeroed on fresh orchestrate.
- `index.ts` snapshot.load handler passes `restoreGraceMs: 3000` in its `orch.attach(...)` opts. Other entry points (`orchestrate`, `orchestrate.resume`) omit it — orchestrate.resume resumes the leader but spawns fresh workers, so the scrollback replay issue doesn't meaningfully apply (no prior worker routing to replay).

### Tests
- 3 new cases in `podiumOrchestratorWorkerMgmt.test.ts`: directives dropped during grace window (no worker write), directives routed normally after window expires, grace disarms after first post-window route with summary log.

## [2.7.27] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Orchestrator team lifecycle: no more ghost teams after tab close or Kill All** — Three related lifecycle bugs surfaced during v2.7.26 verification:
  1. Closing a team's webview tab left the `orchestratorRegistry` entry behind. The Teams tree kept showing the dead team as a live `PodiumLiveTeamNode`; right-clicking `Add Worker` on it routed to a disposed panel and crashed with `addWorker FAILED — Webview is disposed`, **but still spawned an orphan Claude pty process** (pid captured in logs, no owner).
  2. `Kill All Orchestrations` only killed tmux/psmux sessions — `orchestratorRegistry` was never touched, so the tree view stayed cluttered with stale entries even after the nuclear option.
  3. Invoking `Orchestrate Team` multiple times piled new orchestrators on top of old ones with no cleanup path, compounding both issues above.

  Root cause: `LiveMultiPanel.disposeAll()` tore down its `paneExitEmitter` before `pty.kill()`'s `onExit` event could fire, making the `panel.onPaneExit` subscription unreachable on user-driven tab close. `killAll` never looped through `orchestratorRegistry`.

### Internal
- `LiveMultiPanel` gains an explicit `_disposed` flag, a public `isDisposed` getter, and a new `onDidDispose` event. `addPane` / `writeToPane` / `removePane` now early-return no-op on disposed panels so a stale orchestrator reference cannot spawn orphan pty processes. `disposeAll` fires `onDidDispose` before dismantling emitters so subscribers can clean up synchronously. A new public `dispose()` method lets `killAll` tear panels down programmatically.
- `PodiumOrchestrator.isDisposed` getter (reads from the `leader === null` disposal invariant) lets the tree view skip stale entries as a safety net.
- Three `podium.*` command handlers (`orchestrate`, `orchestrate.resume`, `snapshot.load`) now subscribe to `panel.onDidDispose` as a first-class lifecycle path. Both the existing `onPaneExit` path and the new `onDidDispose` path call `orchestratorRegistry.delete(sessionKey)` + `teamsProvider.refresh()` so Teams tree stays consistent under any teardown.
- `claudeCodeLauncher.orchestration.killAll` now loops `orchestratorRegistry` BEFORE running tmux cleanup, disposing each entry, clearing the map, and refreshing the tree. Log line `[orch.killAll] cleared N orchestrator registry entries` surfaces exactly what got torn down.
- `TeamsTreeProvider.getChildren` filters `orch.isDisposed === true` from the root list as belt-and-suspenders protection.

### Tests
- 3 new `liveMultiPanel.test.ts` cases cover the disposal contract: `isDisposed` starts false; `disposeAll` flips it true exactly once; post-dispose `addPane` is a no-op (no pty spawn); `onDidDispose` fires exactly once; `dispose()` is idempotent across repeated calls.

## [2.7.26] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Snapshot restore no longer crashes panes whose workers were never used in the original session** — When `Podium: Save Team Snapshot` captures a team, every pane's pre-allocated session UUID is recorded. But Claude CLI only materializes `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl` AFTER the first user message is submitted through that pane. A worker that was spawned but never routed to in the original session has a UUID the snapshot knows about yet no on-disk transcript. On restore, the previous `--resume <uuid>` flag would fail with "No conversation found with session ID …" and the pane exited with code=1 (observed in the v2.7.25 manual verification flow).

  Restore now probes `isClaudeSessionResumable(cwd, sessionId)` for each pane before spawning. Resumable panes still use `--resume <uuid>` and inherit their prior conversation. Non-resumable panes (no JSONL yet) spawn fresh via `--session-id <uuid>`, preserving the pane's identity in the snapshot ledger so subsequent saves remain consistent. A log line `[orch.snapshot.load] worker <id> has no JSONL transcript (<sid8>); spawning fresh with same session-id` surfaces each fresh spawn for debugging, and a summary `workers: N resumed · M fresh (never used in original session)` lands at the end of the load flow.

### Internal
- `sessionPicker.ts`: new pure helper `isClaudeSessionResumable(cwd, sessionId, home?)` that checks `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<sessionId>.jsonl` via `fs.existsSync`. Exposed alongside `hashCwdForClaudeProjects` / `claudeProjectsDirForCwd` / `listClaudeSessions` for future reuse (e.g. snapshot validators, orphan-cleanup utilities).
- Leader restore path also gains the probe: an unused leader (rare — the protocol acknowledgement usually produces a first turn) spawns fresh with `buildLeaderExtraArgs()` + preserved `sessionId`. Labels switch from `leader (restored XXX)` to `leader (fresh XXX)` so users can tell which panes had prior context.

### Tests
- 4 new `sessionPicker.test.ts` cases cover the probe matrix (JSONL present → true, mixed used/unused pair, missing projects dir → false, empty sessionId → false).

## [2.7.25] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Runtime worker add/remove/rename via TeamsTreeProvider context menus with idle-gated leader notification** — New commands `Podium: Add Worker`, `Podium: Remove Worker`, `Podium: Rename Worker` are accessible from the Teams view context menu or Command Palette. Tree UI surfaces live Podium teams with per-worker children; rename updates the displayed label while keeping the routing key (`worker-N`) immutable.
- Leader pane is auto-notified on add/remove via idle-gated writer with 2-second wall-clock deadline (mirrors existing `tryDispatchPending` pattern) — no interference with in-progress leader turns on Windows/Claude Win32 input mode.
- Runtime cap: `MAX_RUNTIME_WORKERS = 10` per team (matches snapshot retention and SpawnTeamPanel prompt-level guard).

### Fixed
- **N-worker snapshot compatibility — existing 2-worker snapshots continue to load; new N-worker teams save/restore seamlessly** — Snapshot schema version remains unchanged (`SNAPSHOT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`); roundtrip tests cover N=0, 1, 3, 5 workers plus pre-v2.7.25 2-worker fixture regression.

### Internal
- `PodiumOrchestrator` gains `addWorker`, `removeWorker`, `renameWorker`, `scheduleLeaderNotify`, `listWorkers` methods.
- Multi-orchestrator correctness: tree commands route via `sessionKey` rather than "last entry" lookup.
- Pane-first rollback order in `addWorker` prevents orphan Map entries on spawn failure (via new `LiveMultiPanel.hasPane` probe).
- Regression tests: 6 new test cases covering worker lifecycle mutations, snapshot load/save across worker counts, and dissolve × runtime-add/remove/roundtrip scenarios. All tests pass.

### Out of scope for v2.7.25
- Codex/Gemini mixed worker types — runtime Add UI surfaces Claude only.
- Routing-key rename (immutable by design in this version).
- Auxiliary UI label sync (TerminalPanel tabs, Conversation Panel heading text on rename) — tracked as OQ-5 for v2.7.26+.

## [2.7.24] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Dissolve summary now reproduces worker answers verbatim** — The previous Haiku-based summarizer occasionally hallucinated "no answer found in transcript" responses even when workers had clearly printed their results, because the Claude CLI wraps assistant output with Ink frames, leader status lines, and long ANSI chrome that the model was asked to interpret in one pass. Added a deterministic first pass: `extractLastAssistantBullet()` scans the transcript for the `●` glyph that prefixes every finalized assistant reply and returns the text immediately after it (with multi-line indented continuations joined). When *every* worker produces a recognizable bullet line, `claudeBareSummarizer` skips the Haiku call entirely and emits the verbatim `- worker-N: <answer>` list. When at least one worker is missing a bullet, the Haiku fallback still runs, but with a strengthened prompt that explicitly describes the `●` convention ("the text after `●` IS the answer — copy it verbatim; never claim the answer is missing when a `●` line is present"). Verified live against an 8321ch / 3716ch transcript pair with two workers — summary returned in <100 ms (no LLM round-trip) and the leader received `- worker-1: red/blue/green translation - worker-2: 110` exactly as typed by the workers.

### Internal
- 6 new test cases in `test/unit/dissolve.test.ts` covering empty-bullet drop, whitespace-only bullet drop, multi-line indented continuation join, mixed hit/miss → Haiku fallback, all-hit → no-LLM path, and the 8321ch realistic-flood regression. 106/106 tests pass.

## [2.7.23] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Standalone-word spinner rows no longer bleed into dissolve summaries** — Claude CLI v2.1+ occasionally emits the Ink spinner label (`Processing…`, `Thinking…`, etc.) on its own line without the leading Braille glyph that v2.7.20's `SPINNER_RE` relied on. Those orphan-word rows slipped past the chrome filter and the summarizer treated them as worker content. Extended the chrome-filter so these standalone spinner-word rows are dropped too, alongside the existing glyph-prefixed form and the `(esc to interrupt · ctrl+t to show todos)` keyboard hint row.

## [2.7.22] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **IdleDetector no longer misses the Claude v2.1+ prompt when Ink leaves leading whitespace** — The prompt-row regexes (`>` alone and the `[OMC#<version>]` status line) required the line to start at column 0, but Ink's re-wrap pass sometimes emits them with a leading space. Prompt detection would silently miss, which cascaded into routing dispatch waiting forever for an idle signal that never came. All prompt-row patterns now accept leading whitespace, and the new `⏵⏵ bypass permissions` hint that Claude prints right below the prompt is matched too so the idle window closes promptly.
- **`busyWorkers()` is no longer gated on `IdleDetector.isIdle`** — The pre-dissolve UX warning (introduced in v2.7.21) asked `IdleDetector` whether each worker was idle, but the detector's prompt-pattern eviction can flip `isIdle` to `true` the instant the prompt reappears even when fresh output is still arriving. That produced false "all idle" readings and skipped the warning. `busyWorkers()` now inspects the `msSinceLastOutput` timestamp directly, so a worker that has emitted output within the configurable busy threshold is still reported as busy regardless of the idle detector's view.

## [2.7.21] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Dissolve UX warning for busy workers** — Dissolving while a worker is still emitting output means the transcript tail the summarizer sees is incomplete, so the injected summary will miss the actual answer. The Dissolve command now calls `PodiumOrchestrator.busyWorkers()` before proceeding; if any worker has produced output within the configured busy threshold, a modal `showWarningMessage` appears listing each busy worker with its time-since-output and offers `Dissolve anyway` / `Cancel`. Both the cancel path and the "confirmed despite busy" path are logged to the Orchestration output channel for post-hoc diagnosis of rushed dissolves.
- **Team Snapshot: rename** — Snapshot entries persisted in `claudeTeams.json` can now be renamed via the `Team Snapshot: rename` command. Complements the v2.7.19 snapshot save/load pair; a proper UI-level rename affordance in the snapshot list view is tracked for a later milestone.

### Fixed
- **Ghost "leader referenced unknown worker-N" spam after dissolve is eliminated at the source** — After `dissolve()` clears the workers Map, the leader pane stays alive and Ink occasionally repaints scrollback rows that still contain old `@worker-N:` directives. The router had no target to deliver these to and logged a `leader referenced unknown "worker-N" — dropped` line for each ghost directive, which polluted the output channel with several lines per second during the post-dissolve repaint. `consumeLeaderOutput()` now short-circuits with an early return whenever `this.workers.size === 0`, so the projector never accumulates ghost state and the parser is never invoked; no log noise, no wasted cycles, and the leader's pty → webview rendering (handled by `LiveMultiPanel`, not this path) is unaffected.

## [2.6.19] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Mouse wheel scroll restored in Podium-ready sessions** — v2.6.15 set `set -g mouse off` in the leader tmux conf to work around a drag-selection auto-clear regression, but the side effect was that tmux dropped the SGR wheel reports emitted by xterm.js's wheel-forward path. The inner TUI (Claude CLI) never saw scroll events, making alt-screen scrollback unreachable in every Podium-ready pane. Restored `set -g mouse on` and mitigated the original regression by unbinding `MouseDrag1Pane` / `MouseDragEnd1Pane` in `root`, `copy-mode`, and `copy-mode-vi` tables — tmux no longer hijacks drag selections into copy-mode, so xterm.js's native text selection stays intact while wheel events pass through to the inner program. `~/.claude-launcher/tmux-leader.conf` is rewritten by `ensureLeaderConf()` on next extension activation; existing psmux sessions are unaffected until restarted, because tmux only loads the conf at `new-session`.

## [2.6.6] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Interactive prompt detection — fast-path to needs-attention** — When the PTY emits a Claude CLI confirmation prompt ("Do you want to…", "[Y/n]", "Press Enter to continue…", etc.), the tab now flips to `needs-attention` immediately instead of waiting out the 7-second running threshold. Brief prompts that finished setup in 2 seconds and silently sat asking for a Yes/No no longer go unnoticed.
- **Tab title blink while needs-attention** — The webview tab title prefixes a `⚠` glyph that flashes every 800 ms whenever the tab is unfocused **and** in `needs-attention` state. Self-stops when you focus the tab, when the state transitions away, or when the panel is disposed. Combined with the existing desktop notification + status bar prominent background, the tab is now genuinely hard to miss when Claude is waiting for an answer.

## [2.6.5] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Reorder custom buttons in settings** — Each custom button row in the Settings → Custom Buttons list now has ▲/▼ arrows next to the delete X. Click to swap with the adjacent row. The top row's ▲ and the bottom row's ▼ are hidden so you always know what will happen. Order is persisted to `customButtons` and reloads into the toolbar on the next window reload.
- **Edit custom buttons in place** — Click the label or command text of any custom button row to turn it into an inline input. Enter commits the edit, Escape cancels, blur commits. No separate edit dialog — same hover affordance pattern as the delete X and the new move arrows.
- **Auto /effort max on first idle** — Optional toggle in Settings. When on, each session automatically sends `/effort max` the first time it reaches an idle state after startup. Useful when Reload Window restores many resume-later sessions and you want them all back on max effort without visiting each tab. Off by default. Fires once per session — manually changing the effort later is not overridden.

### Changed
- **Smooth wheel scroll in normal mode** — Enabled xterm.js `smoothScrollDuration: 120` so wheel scrolling over the scrollback buffer glides between frames instead of jumping line-by-line. Applies only to xterm's native scroll API path (normal buffer with scrollback), so fullscreen TUI mode is unaffected — the TUI (Claude CLI) still drives its own partial redraws there, and any fake CSS smoothing would collide with partial frame updates and re-introduce ghost artifacts.

## [2.6.4] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Redraw screen — recover from fullscreen rendering corruption without losing context** — Wheel scrolling in Claude CLI's fullscreen TUI sometimes leaves overlapping text or ghost lines behind (the TUI's partial-redraw pipeline doesn't always flush its frame buffer cleanly). Added a `↻` button in the toolbar (visible only while alternate screen is active) and a `Ctrl+Shift+R` shortcut that trigger a full redraw. Mechanism: webview repaints xterm via `term.refresh()`, then the extension toggles the PTY size by 1 column and back — Claude CLI receives two SIGWINCH signals and redraws from scratch. Unlike `/clear` or `/compact`, **no session, scrollback, or conversation state is touched** — it's a purely visual refresh.

## [2.6.3] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **FS mode stuck detecting fullscreen when Claude CLI isn't in it — wheel scroll broken** — The mouse-mode tracking flag was kept alive by the enable/disable escape sequences alone. If Claude ever failed to emit the disable sequence on TUI exit (or a write-chunk boundary sliced the sequence and broke our regex), `isMouseMode` stayed `true` indefinitely, hijacking wheel events into SGR reports that the non-fullscreen Claude CLI couldn't consume. Now wheel forwarding requires **both** `isAlternateScreen` (authoritative via `term.buffer.onBufferChange`) **and** `isMouseMode`, and any return to the normal screen buffer force-clears the mouse-mode flag.

### Added
- **Click FS indicator to force normal mode** — Escape hatch for rare cases where detection is still wrong. Clicking the amber `FS` badge in the toolbar toggles a user override: the badge turns grey, strikes through (`FS×`), and the terminal behaves as if fullscreen were off — wheel scrolls locally, drag/copy work as usual. Click again to return to auto-detect. The override auto-clears when the buffer returns to normal, so you don't have to remember to toggle it back.

## [2.6.2] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Ctrl+C still forwarded to PTY after copy (leaking ^C to Claude CLI exit prep)** — The v2.6.1 document-level Ctrl+C handler correctly did the clipboard copy, but it also naively skipped all `<textarea>` targets to preserve native input copy. xterm.js uses a hidden `xterm-helper-textarea` to capture keyboard input, so focus inside the terminal classified as TEXTAREA → the handler skipped → xterm's internal processing forwarded ^C to the PTY. Claude CLI then started its "Press Ctrl+C again to exit" countdown even though the copy had succeeded. Now we detect xterm's internal textarea by checking `#terminal.contains(e.target)` and always proceed with copy in that case, only bailing for real user-facing inputs. Added `stopImmediatePropagation()` and restored a selection-guard inside `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` (returns `false` when selection exists) as belt-and-suspenders protection.
- **Open Folder failed for partial/nested paths** — `handleOpenFile` had a basename-search fallback that walked the cwd tree up to depth 6 to locate files like `slack-manifests/01-demand-forecast.yaml`, but `handleOpenFolder` skipped this branch and just errored out when the first resolve attempt failed. Mirrored the same fallback so selecting a relative file path and choosing "Open Folder" now finds the file anywhere in the workspace tree and opens its containing directory in the OS file explorer.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- **Context indicator click → `/compact`** — Clicking the toolbar context-usage bar used to re-query usage via `/context`. But usage already updates automatically from output, so the click was most often used when the bar entered the danger zone and the user wanted to compact anyway. One less command to type.

### Fixed
- **Ctrl+C copy unreliable after drag-select** — `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` only fires when xterm's internal textarea has focus, but drag-to-select in fullscreen/alternate-screen mode can leave focus on the viewport div instead. Moved the Ctrl+C copy logic to a document-level capture-phase listener so it runs regardless of which element inside the webview holds focus. Real `<input>`/`<textarea>` targets are skipped so native input-field copy still works, and the "send ^C to PTY when no selection" path is preserved (non-handled events fall through to xterm's default).

## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Custom session sorting** — Sessions within a group (or at top level in Recent Sessions) can now be reordered manually. Two methods: (1) right-click → "Move Up" / "Move Down" for precise adjustments, (2) drag-and-drop for direct positioning. Sort order is persisted in `claudeSessionSortOrder` and takes precedence over the default mtime-based order.
- **2-level session nesting** — Sessions can now contain sub-sessions for hierarchical organization. Right-click a top-level session → "Nest Under Session..." → pick a parent from the QuickPick. Maximum depth is 2 (Group → Session → Sub-session). Sub-sessions appear indented under their parent regardless of their own group membership. Use "Unnest (Move to Top Level)" on a sub-session to flatten it back.
- **Drag & drop session management** — Drag a session onto a custom group → moves it there. Drag onto another session → inserts it right before the target, inheriting the target's group and parent (so dropping on a sub-session places the dragged item as a sibling under the same parent). Multi-select is supported (`canSelectMany: true`). 2-level safety guard prevents drops that would exceed the depth limit.
- **Custom group ordering** — Groups can now be reordered the same two ways as sessions: (1) right-click a group header → "Move Group Up" / "Move Group Down", (2) drag a group header onto another group to insert it right before. Group order is persisted by rewriting the `claudeSessionGroups` object with the new key order (modern JS engines preserve non-integer-string key insertion order).

### Changed
- **Session icons — titled vs untitled** — Titled sessions (with a user-assigned name) use `comment-discussion` (two overlapping speech bubbles). Untitled sessions use `comment-draft` (dashed-border bubble) so the two kinds are visually distinguishable at a glance. Removed the earlier `folder` override that rendered every grouped session identical to its group header.
- **Context value assignments** — Tree items now carry explicit `contextValue` strings (`session`, `subSession`, `customGroup`, `recentGroup`, `resumeLaterGroup`, `trashGroup`, `trashed`). Existing `moveToGroup` / `trashSession` menu conditions switched from negative matching to positive matching so they no longer leak onto group headers.

### Internal
- `SessionTreeDataProvider` gains `handleDrag` / `handleDrop` (for `TreeDragAndDropController`) and helpers `_getScope` / `_getSiblings` / `_writeSortOrder` / `moveSessionUp` / `moveSessionDown` / `setSessionParent` / `removeSessionParent` / `moveGroupUp` / `moveGroupDown` / `_reorderGroupsBefore` / `_writeGroupOrder`.
- D&D uses two MIME types — `application/vnd.code.tree.claudecodelauncher.sessions` (session items) and `...groups` (custom group headers) — so group drags can't accidentally act like session moves.
- New storage keys: `claudeSessionSortOrder` (integer map, sparse 10/20/30...) and `claudeSessionParent` (session→parent sessionId map). No migration needed; group order continues to live in `claudeSessionGroups` key order.

## [2.5.7] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Fullscreen mode detection & indicator** — Claude CLI's new fullscreen mode uses alternate screen buffer + mouse reporting, which breaks text selection and other launcher features. The launcher now detects both `\e[?1049h` (alternate screen) and `\e[?100Xh` (mouse tracking) escape sequences in real-time and shows an amber "FS" badge in the toolbar. A one-time toast hint reminds the user that Shift+drag bypasses mouse capture for text selection.
- **Context menu works in fullscreen** — Right-click context menu listener switched from bubble to capture phase, so it fires even when xterm.js mouse reporting intercepts and stops propagation of the event.
- **Export warns in alternate screen** — When exporting from fullscreen mode, a toast warns that only the current viewport is captured (the normal buffer with full scroll history is not accessible from the alternate screen).
- **Scroll FAB auto-hidden in fullscreen** — The scroll-to-bottom button is suppressed in alternate screen mode since the TUI application manages its own scrolling.

## [2.5.6] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Toast "열기" link after paste-to-file** — When a large paste is saved to a temp file, the notification toast shows a clickable `[열기]` link that opens the saved text file in the editor. Lets you verify exactly what Claude will see via the `@path` reference.
- **Toast "취소" link on attachments** — Both the text paste-to-file toast and the image paste toast now carry a red `[취소]` link. Clicking it sends N DELs (0x7f) into the PTY to wipe the just-injected `@path`/image-path from the prompt and deletes the backing temp file, so the attachment never existed as far as Claude is concerned. Saves you hitting backspace N-hundred times. Caveat: if you've already typed prompt text after the paste, those trailing chars get erased first — cancel promptly.
- **Image paste thumbnail preview** — When a screenshot is pasted, the toast now renders a small thumbnail (max 96×64) of the exact bitmap that was captured, so a wrong clipboard (pasted the previous screenshot by mistake) is obvious before Claude sees it. Thumbnail is reused on the success toast, which additionally gets the `[열기]` + `[취소]` links.
- **TSV → Markdown preview in toast** — Conversion toast previously said only "TSV → Markdown 표 변환". It now reports dimensions, e.g. "📊 TSV → Markdown: 6행 × 4열", so a wrong clipboard is obvious at a glance.

### Fixed
- **Toast action links weren't clickable** — `#paste-toast` had `pointer-events:none` in CSS (so the toast wouldn't block terminal clicks under it). That also blocked the new `[열기]` link. Root fix: keep the toast non-interactive by default, but set `pointer-events:auto` on action links individually.
- **Idle 1s scroll polling removed (B4)** — `scroll-fab` visibility was driven by a 1-second `setInterval(checkScroll, 1000)` on every open panel, doing a DOM query even when the terminal was idle. Replaced with a direct `scroll` listener on xterm's `.xterm-viewport` element (attached once it materializes). Zero work while idle; identical behavior when scrolling.

### Internal
- `tryConvertTsvToMarkdown` now returns `{ markdown, rows, cols } | null` instead of `text`. Callers switched to explicit null check.
- `showToast(message, opts)` now accepts `opts.actions = [{ label, onClick, color? }, ...]` for multi-link rows; legacy `opts.action` still supported. New `opts.image` renders a prepended thumbnail. Toast auto-dismiss bumped 2.5s → 4s to give time to click.
- `paste-file-ready` / `image-paste-result` messages carry `fullPath` (native separators) alongside `cliPath`. New router cases: `open-paste-file` (routes to `vscode.open`), `cancel-paste-file` (unlinks the temp file).

## [2.5.5] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Excel cell selection pasted as PNG instead of text** — Excel puts both tab-separated text AND a rendered PNG on the clipboard for any cell range. The v2.5.4 paste handler iterated `clipboardData.items` and caught the image entry first, which meant tabular data was silently uploaded as an image instead of kept as text. Paste now **prioritizes text**: if `clipboardData.getData('text')` returns anything, the text path runs (with optional TSV→Markdown conversion and the existing size-based paste-to-file threshold). Image handling only fires when there is no text on the clipboard (pure screenshots).

### Added
- **TSV → Markdown table auto-conversion** — When a paste is detected as a tab-separated table (≥2 rows with the same ≥2 column count), it is converted to a Markdown table before injection so Claude can parse it directly. Enabled by default; disable with `claudeCodeLauncher.pasteTableAsMarkdown = false` to keep the raw TSV. `|` characters inside cells are escaped as `\\|` to keep the table valid. Converted pastes are injected via `term.paste()` so xterm's bracketed-paste wrapping still applies.

## [2.5.4] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Paste truncation — root workaround via `@path`** — v2.4.3's 256B/20ms chunked writes still lost bytes in prolonged large pastes because Ink (Claude CLI's TUI layer) runs its own line editor on top of ConPTY, and that editor drops bytes when reads can't keep up with writes over ~1–2KB. Chunking only lowered the rate, didn't remove the drop. Now when clipboard text exceeds `claudeCodeLauncher.pasteToFileThreshold` characters (default **2000**, set `0` to disable), the webview intercepts the paste, saves the text to `<os.tmpdir()>/claude-launcher-paste/paste-<timestamp>-<rand>.txt`, and injects `@<absolute-path> ` into the PTY instead. The CLI's `@file` reference reads the file directly, sidestepping PTY bulk-write entirely. No truncation possible because the PTY only sees a short path. Temp files older than 7 days are swept on each paste.
- **Export Conversation — transcript corrupted by terminal reflow (redone correctly)** — v2.5.2 tried to fix this by capturing raw `pty.onData` bytes and stripping ANSI, but Claude CLI is an Ink (TUI) app that expresses layout via cursor-move + partial writes, so blind ANSI stripping discards layout meaning and produces mangled text. Export now uses `term.selectAll() + term.getSelection()`, which runs through xterm.js's virtual-terminal state machine (already handles cursor moves, `isWrapped` line merges, and render state) and then trims trailing whitespace per line. Render output is now export output.

### Added
- **`claudeCodeLauncher.pasteToFileThreshold`** setting (default 2000, min 0) — 0 disables the paste-to-file behavior and restores direct PTY paste for all sizes.

### Removed
- `src/pty/rawBuffer.js` and related `appendRaw`/`resetRaw` hooks added in v2.5.2 (unused after switching Export to `getSelection`).

## [2.5.2] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Export Conversation — transcript corrupted by terminal reflow** — Previously the transcript was reconstructed by iterating xterm's render buffer (`term.buffer.active.getLine(i).translateToString(true)`). Two failure modes stacked: (1) soft-wrapped long lines (e.g. a long URL warning exceeding `cols`) were split across physical rows and `\n`-joined, chopping one sentence into two; (2) Windows ConPTY live-reflows already-emitted lines when the terminal resizes, which could then collapse many logical lines into one very wide row padded with hundreds of trailing spaces — producing the wall-of-spaces blob users reported. Export now reads from a new **per-entry raw PTY capture** (`pty.onData` → `entry.rawOutput`, ring-trimmed at 10MB by whole lines) and runs it through a dedicated `sanitizeForExport()` that strips CSI/OSC/DCS escape sequences, collapses `\r\n` → `\n`, and resolves lone `\r` progress-bar overwrites by keeping only the text after the last `\r` on each line. Render state of the terminal no longer affects export fidelity.

### Internal
- New module `src/pty/rawBuffer.js` (`appendRaw` / `resetRaw` / `sanitizeForExport` / `MAX_RAW_BUFFER = 10MB`).
- `pty.onData` handlers in `createPanel.js` + `restartPty.js` call `appendRaw(entry, data)`; `restartPty` calls `resetRaw(entry)` when spawning the new process so a restart starts the raw transcript fresh.
- `handleExportConversation` signature changed from `(text, entry, panel)` to `(entry, panel)`. Webview no longer scrapes its render buffer; it just sends `{ type: 'export-conversation' }`.
- `entry.rawOutput` is in-memory only (not persisted to `sessions.json`).

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **`sessions.json` partial-write / cross-window race** — `sessionStoreUpdate` previously did `readFileSync` → mutate → `writeFileSync`, so two windows (or two flushes inside one window) flushing back-to-back could clobber each other's keys, and a crash mid-write left a truncated/corrupt JSON file the next launch couldn't parse. Writes now go through a `.tmp.<pid>.<ts>` file with `fsync` + atomic `rename`, and tmp files are cleaned up on failure.
- **Particle effect RAF kept burning CPU when disabled** — `animateParticles` re-scheduled itself via `requestAnimationFrame` every frame even when `particlesEnabled` was off, leaving an idle ~60 fps no-op loop running. Now the loop exits on disable, and both toggle paths (right-click "Particles" + slash command `toggle-particles`) restart it on re-enable.

### Removed
- **Dead `set-memo` message handler** — Router accepted a `set-memo` webview message that no client code ever sent (real memo flow is `request-edit-memo` → `showInputBox` → `memo-updated`). Removed handler + protocol comment.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **Internal refactor — module split** — `extension.js` (4,386 lines) split into a thin 3-line entry + 23 modules under `src/`. No user-visible behavior changes. Structure only. Module layout:
  - `src/activation.js` — activate/deactivate lifecycle, command registration (10 commands under `claudeCodeLauncher.*`)
  - `src/state.js` — runtime state singleton (panels Map, tabCounter, statusBar, sessionTreeProvider, context)
  - `src/i18n/` — locale strings (en/ko) and runtime resolution
  - `src/store/` — session JSON persistence (`sessions.json`) + save/restore
  - `src/tree/` — `SessionTreeDataProvider` for the sidebar
  - `src/pty/` — `writePtyChunked`/`killPtyProcess`/`resolveClaudeCli` + `createContextParser()` factory (dedupes what was previously duplicated between createPanel and restartPty)
  - `src/panel/` — `createPanel`, `restartPty`, `messageRouter` (19 webview→ext types dispatched from one table), `statusIndicator`, `webviewContent`/`webviewStyles`/`webviewClient` (HTML/CSS/JS separated as JS modules; true static split scheduled for v2.6)
  - `src/handlers/` — toolbar, openFile (with partial-path recovery), openFolder, pasteImage, dropFiles, exportConversation, desktopNotification

### Fixed
- **XSS via innerHTML (pre-existing, hardened during refactor)** — Settings list renders for custom buttons / custom slash commands / file associations / slash menu concatenated user input directly into `innerHTML`. Added `escapeHtml()` helper and applied it at 5 injection points. DOM structure unchanged, string sanitization only.

### Internal
- Session schema (`sessions.json` keys and 6-field session object) unchanged — existing user sessions load transparently.
- Command IDs under `claudeCodeLauncher.*` preserved (legacy naming kept to protect existing `keybindings.json` bindings).
- `WebviewPanelSerializer` still not used — retained self-managed restore via `sessions.json` and activate-time `restoreSessions`.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Long paste truncation (recurrence)** — v2.4.0's `writePtyChunked` (1024B/10ms) still dropped bytes on Windows ConPTY under sustained writes, and concurrent `writePtyChunked` calls (paste + typing) could interleave chunks because each call started its own setTimeout chain. Now a per-entry write queue serializes all writes, chunk size dropped to 256B and delay bumped to 20ms for ConPTY buffer headroom, and chunk boundaries skip UTF-16 surrogate pair splits so emoji/astral chars don't corrupt.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Open File — Windows default app not launched** — Two issues combined silently: (1) `vscode.env.openExternal(Uri.file(...))` on Windows/Antigravity didn't hand off to the OS default app, and (2) when users had explicit `fileAssociations` like `.xlsx→excel`, the code invoked `spawn('excel', [...])` which fails with ENOENT since `excel` isn't in PATH. Both paths now route through `cmd.exe /c start "" "<path>"` (with `windowsVerbatimArguments` so `cmd` sees the quoted path intact), deferring to Windows file association to resolve the default app. Added a spawn error listener so future failures surface as a warning toast instead of silent.
- **Open File — partial/mid-drag selection** — "Open File" now uses the same `resolvePathFragment` recovery as Open Folder (cwd → ancestors → home dir → platform roots), so mid-drag fragments like `Downloads\foo.xlsx` resolve correctly. Previously only the basename-search fallback ran, which couldn't reach files outside `entry.cwd` (e.g. `~/Downloads`) and silently failed with "File not found".
- **`~` expansion for Open File** — `~`, `~/foo` now expand to the home directory.
- **Directory-as-file rejection** — If the resolved path points to a directory, Open File now warns instead of attempting to open it as a file.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Open Folder — partial/mid-drag selection** — Context menu "Open Folder" now correctly resolves partial paths (e.g., mid-drag of an absolute path selecting `rockuen/obsidian/...`). Introduced `resolvePathFragment` which tries cwd → ancestors (walk-up) → home dir → platform roots (`/Users` on Mac, `/home` on Linux), accepting only paths that actually exist. Previously walked up to any existing parent and silently opened the wrong folder (often cwd).
- **Open Folder — lost selection on right-click** — Some environments (notably Mac Electron + xterm canvas) cleared the selection during `mousedown`/`contextmenu`, causing "Select text first" toasts even with visible selection. Now caches the selection at `contextmenu` time and falls back to it when live selection is empty.
- **`~` expansion** — `~`, `~/foo` now expand to home directory on Mac/Linux.

### Added
- **Open Folder — success toast** — Shows "Open folder: <path>" on success (parity with Open File).
- **Invalid path warning** — Shows "Cannot open folder (invalid or partial path)" instead of silently opening an unrelated ancestor directory.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-08

### Security
- **Command injection hardening** — Replaced all `exec()` with `execFile`/`spawn` + argument arrays (`killPtyProcess`, `showDesktopNotification`, `handleOpenFile`, `handleOpenFolder`, `readClipboardImageFromSystem`)
- **URL scheme validation** — `open-link` handler now rejects non-http(s) URLs (prevents `javascript:`, `vscode:` execution)
- **Windows path injection fix** — `openNative` uses `vscode.env.openExternal` instead of `cmd /c start` for untrusted paths

### Fixed
- **Long text paste truncation** — `writePtyChunked()` splits large inputs into 1024-byte chunks with 10ms intervals (ConPTY buffer overflow fix)
- **Stale PTY handler race** — Added `entry.pty !== thisPty` guard on all `onData`/`onExit` handlers to prevent old PTY exit events from corrupting new PTY state
- **Restart PTY robustness** — Kill old PTY before spawn, reset `_disposed` flag, debounce with `_restarting` guard, use stored `cols/rows` instead of hardcoded 120x30
- **Deactivate saves dead sessions** — Filter `!entry.pty` entries to prevent restoring finished conversations on reload
- **Null PTY guards** — `handlePasteImage`, `handleDropFiles` now check `entry.pty` before write
- **File descriptor leak** — `_extractFirstUserMessage` uses `try/finally` for `fs.closeSync`
- **Particle animation** — Skip render loop when particles are disabled (CPU savings)
- **CLI resolve timeout** — `execFileSync` with 1.5s timeout (was `execSync` 3s blocking)

## [2.3.7] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **"Webview is disposed" errors** — Added `_disposed` guard flag and `try/catch` protection to all async `postMessage` calls (PTY `onExit`, `setTimeout` callbacks, clipboard `exec`). Cleared `runningDelayTimer` in `onDidDispose` to prevent stale timer firing.

## [2.3.6] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **Clean copy (trim trailing whitespace)** — `getCleanSelection()` trims trailing spaces from each line when copying terminal text. Applied to Ctrl+C, context menu Copy, Open File, and Open Folder.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Context usage parsing overhaul** — Comprehensive ANSI strip (CSI, OSC, 2-byte ESC, all control chars including CR/DEL), rolling 300-char buffer for cross-chunk pattern capture, optional colon in keyword regex (`컨텍스트:` format), broad fallback regex for resilient % detection

### Added
- **Inline group management icons** — Rename/Delete icons on custom group headers, Empty Trash icon on trash group header
- **Session group context values** — `customGroup` and `trashGroup` context values for precise menu targeting
- **Group rename command** — Rename groups with expanded state preservation
- **Debug logging** — One-time context buffer sample log for parsing diagnostics

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Custom session groups** — Unlimited user-defined groups, QuickPick session move, "Remove from Group" to ungroup
- **Trash / Restore** — Delete moves sessions to trash folder, Restore brings them back, Empty Trash with confirmation dialog
- **Group collapse state persistence** — `onDidExpandElement`/`onDidCollapseElement` tracking, restored on refresh
- **i18n nls files** — `package.nls.json` (English) + `package.nls.ko.json` (Korean) for sidebar labels

### Fixed
- **`const projDir` duplicate declaration** — Reused variable in `_buildGroups()` for Trash group

## [2.1.6] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **CLI resolution for npm installs** — Fixed "Cannot create process, error code 2" on Windows when Claude CLI is installed via `npm install -g`. node-pty cannot execute `.cmd` shim files directly; now wraps with `cmd.exe /c` automatically.
- Unified CLI path resolution into `resolveClaudeCli()` function (3-step: `~/.local/bin` → npm global → PATH fallback)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **i18n support** — English and Korean, auto-detected from IDE language setting
- **Settings modal** — In-extension settings UI (gear icon / right-click menu)
  - Theme, font size, font family, sound, particles toggle
  - Custom buttons and slash commands management
  - Export/Import settings as JSON for sharing
- **Context usage indicator** — Toolbar progress bar showing token usage (click to refresh)
- **Custom slash commands** — User-defined commands in autocomplete dropdown via settings
- **Custom buttons** — Configurable input panel buttons via settings
- **Ctrl+C copy** — Copy selected text with Ctrl+C, send interrupt when no selection
- **CLI not found detection** — Shows install guide when Claude Code CLI is missing

### Changed
- Toolbar simplified — removed zoom, paste image, sound buttons (accessible via settings/shortcuts)
- Queue button unified — single button for add + run
- Slash commands genericized — standard CLI commands only, personal skills via custom settings

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- Webview + xterm.js + node-pty based terminal
- Tab icon status display (idle/running/done/error)
- Session save/restore with split view support
- Slash command autocomplete (/ input dropdown)
- Task queue with sequential execution
- Input history (Ctrl+Up/Down)
- Image paste (PowerShell/osascript fallback)
- Windows desktop toast notifications
- 7 background themes with ambient glow effects
- Background particle effects
- Tab color tags, tab memo
- File path click to open (Obsidian/browser/editor)
- Keyboard shortcut overlay (Ctrl+?)
- Search bar (Ctrl+F) with xterm-addon-search
- Conversation export to markdown
- Response timer
- "Close (Resume Later)" with sidebar session grouping
- Cross-platform support (Windows/Mac)
- Install script (install.sh)
