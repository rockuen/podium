# Changelog

## [2.5.6] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Toast "열기" link after paste-to-file** — When a large paste is saved to a temp file, the notification toast shows a clickable `[열기]` link that opens the saved text file in the editor. Lets you verify exactly what Claude will see via the `@path` reference.
- **Toast "취소" link on attachments** — Both the text paste-to-file toast and the image paste toast now carry a red `[취소]` link. Clicking it sends N DELs (0x7f) into the PTY to wipe the just-injected `@path`/image-path from the prompt and deletes the backing temp file, so the attachment never existed as far as Claude is concerned. Saves you hitting backspace N-hundred times. Caveat: if you've already typed prompt text after the paste, those trailing chars get erased first — cancel promptly.
- **Image paste thumbnail preview** — When a screenshot is pasted, the toast now renders a small thumbnail (max 96×64) of the exact bitmap that was captured, so a wrong clipboard (pasted the previous screenshot by mistake) is obvious before Claude sees it. Thumbnail is reused on the success toast, which additionally gets the `[열기]` + `[취소]` links.
- **TSV → Markdown preview in toast** — Conversion toast previously said only "TSV → Markdown 표 변환". It now reports dimensions, e.g. "📊 TSV → Markdown: 6행 × 4열", so a wrong clipboard is obvious at a glance.

### Fixed
- **Toast action links weren't clickable** — `#paste-toast` had `pointer-events:none` in CSS (so the toast wouldn't block terminal clicks under it). That also blocked the new `[열기]` link. Root fix: keep the toast non-interactive by default, but set `pointer-events:auto` on action links individually.
- **Idle 1s scroll polling removed (B4)** — `scroll-fab` visibility was driven by a 1-second `setInterval(checkScroll, 1000)` on every open panel, doing a DOM query even when the terminal was idle. Replaced with a direct `scroll` listener on xterm's `.xterm-viewport` element (attached once it materializes). Zero work while idle; identical behavior when scrolling.

### Internal
- `tryConvertTsvToMarkdown` now returns `{ markdown, rows, cols } | null` instead of `text`. Callers switched to explicit null check.
- `showToast(message, opts)` now accepts `opts.actions = [{ label, onClick, color? }, ...]` for multi-link rows; legacy `opts.action` still supported. New `opts.image` renders a prepended thumbnail. Toast auto-dismiss bumped 2.5s → 4s to give time to click.
- `paste-file-ready` / `image-paste-result` messages carry `fullPath` (native separators) alongside `cliPath`. New router cases: `open-paste-file` (routes to `vscode.open`), `cancel-paste-file` (unlinks the temp file).

## [2.5.5] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Excel cell selection pasted as PNG instead of text** — Excel puts both tab-separated text AND a rendered PNG on the clipboard for any cell range. The v2.5.4 paste handler iterated `clipboardData.items` and caught the image entry first, which meant tabular data was silently uploaded as an image instead of kept as text. Paste now **prioritizes text**: if `clipboardData.getData('text')` returns anything, the text path runs (with optional TSV→Markdown conversion and the existing size-based paste-to-file threshold). Image handling only fires when there is no text on the clipboard (pure screenshots).

### Added
- **TSV → Markdown table auto-conversion** — When a paste is detected as a tab-separated table (≥2 rows with the same ≥2 column count), it is converted to a Markdown table before injection so Claude can parse it directly. Enabled by default; disable with `claudeCodeLauncher.pasteTableAsMarkdown = false` to keep the raw TSV. `|` characters inside cells are escaped as `\\|` to keep the table valid. Converted pastes are injected via `term.paste()` so xterm's bracketed-paste wrapping still applies.

## [2.5.4] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Paste truncation — root workaround via `@path`** — v2.4.3's 256B/20ms chunked writes still lost bytes in prolonged large pastes because Ink (Claude CLI's TUI layer) runs its own line editor on top of ConPTY, and that editor drops bytes when reads can't keep up with writes over ~1–2KB. Chunking only lowered the rate, didn't remove the drop. Now when clipboard text exceeds `claudeCodeLauncher.pasteToFileThreshold` characters (default **2000**, set `0` to disable), the webview intercepts the paste, saves the text to `<os.tmpdir()>/claude-launcher-paste/paste-<timestamp>-<rand>.txt`, and injects `@<absolute-path> ` into the PTY instead. The CLI's `@file` reference reads the file directly, sidestepping PTY bulk-write entirely. No truncation possible because the PTY only sees a short path. Temp files older than 7 days are swept on each paste.
- **Export Conversation — transcript corrupted by terminal reflow (redone correctly)** — v2.5.2 tried to fix this by capturing raw `pty.onData` bytes and stripping ANSI, but Claude CLI is an Ink (TUI) app that expresses layout via cursor-move + partial writes, so blind ANSI stripping discards layout meaning and produces mangled text. Export now uses `term.selectAll() + term.getSelection()`, which runs through xterm.js's virtual-terminal state machine (already handles cursor moves, `isWrapped` line merges, and render state) and then trims trailing whitespace per line. Render output is now export output.

### Added
- **`claudeCodeLauncher.pasteToFileThreshold`** setting (default 2000, min 0) — 0 disables the paste-to-file behavior and restores direct PTY paste for all sizes.

### Removed
- `src/pty/rawBuffer.js` and related `appendRaw`/`resetRaw` hooks added in v2.5.2 (unused after switching Export to `getSelection`).

## [2.5.2] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Export Conversation — transcript corrupted by terminal reflow** — Previously the transcript was reconstructed by iterating xterm's render buffer (`term.buffer.active.getLine(i).translateToString(true)`). Two failure modes stacked: (1) soft-wrapped long lines (e.g. a long URL warning exceeding `cols`) were split across physical rows and `\n`-joined, chopping one sentence into two; (2) Windows ConPTY live-reflows already-emitted lines when the terminal resizes, which could then collapse many logical lines into one very wide row padded with hundreds of trailing spaces — producing the wall-of-spaces blob users reported. Export now reads from a new **per-entry raw PTY capture** (`pty.onData` → `entry.rawOutput`, ring-trimmed at 10MB by whole lines) and runs it through a dedicated `sanitizeForExport()` that strips CSI/OSC/DCS escape sequences, collapses `\r\n` → `\n`, and resolves lone `\r` progress-bar overwrites by keeping only the text after the last `\r` on each line. Render state of the terminal no longer affects export fidelity.

### Internal
- New module `src/pty/rawBuffer.js` (`appendRaw` / `resetRaw` / `sanitizeForExport` / `MAX_RAW_BUFFER = 10MB`).
- `pty.onData` handlers in `createPanel.js` + `restartPty.js` call `appendRaw(entry, data)`; `restartPty` calls `resetRaw(entry)` when spawning the new process so a restart starts the raw transcript fresh.
- `handleExportConversation` signature changed from `(text, entry, panel)` to `(entry, panel)`. Webview no longer scrapes its render buffer; it just sends `{ type: 'export-conversation' }`.
- `entry.rawOutput` is in-memory only (not persisted to `sessions.json`).

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **`sessions.json` partial-write / cross-window race** — `sessionStoreUpdate` previously did `readFileSync` → mutate → `writeFileSync`, so two windows (or two flushes inside one window) flushing back-to-back could clobber each other's keys, and a crash mid-write left a truncated/corrupt JSON file the next launch couldn't parse. Writes now go through a `.tmp.<pid>.<ts>` file with `fsync` + atomic `rename`, and tmp files are cleaned up on failure.
- **Particle effect RAF kept burning CPU when disabled** — `animateParticles` re-scheduled itself via `requestAnimationFrame` every frame even when `particlesEnabled` was off, leaving an idle ~60 fps no-op loop running. Now the loop exits on disable, and both toggle paths (right-click "Particles" + slash command `toggle-particles`) restart it on re-enable.

### Removed
- **Dead `set-memo` message handler** — Router accepted a `set-memo` webview message that no client code ever sent (real memo flow is `request-edit-memo` → `showInputBox` → `memo-updated`). Removed handler + protocol comment.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **Internal refactor — module split** — `extension.js` (4,386 lines) split into a thin 3-line entry + 23 modules under `src/`. No user-visible behavior changes. Structure only. Module layout:
  - `src/activation.js` — activate/deactivate lifecycle, command registration (10 commands under `claudeCodeLauncher.*`)
  - `src/state.js` — runtime state singleton (panels Map, tabCounter, statusBar, sessionTreeProvider, context)
  - `src/i18n/` — locale strings (en/ko) and runtime resolution
  - `src/store/` — session JSON persistence (`sessions.json`) + save/restore
  - `src/tree/` — `SessionTreeDataProvider` for the sidebar
  - `src/pty/` — `writePtyChunked`/`killPtyProcess`/`resolveClaudeCli` + `createContextParser()` factory (dedupes what was previously duplicated between createPanel and restartPty)
  - `src/panel/` — `createPanel`, `restartPty`, `messageRouter` (19 webview→ext types dispatched from one table), `statusIndicator`, `webviewContent`/`webviewStyles`/`webviewClient` (HTML/CSS/JS separated as JS modules; true static split scheduled for v2.6)
  - `src/handlers/` — toolbar, openFile (with partial-path recovery), openFolder, pasteImage, dropFiles, exportConversation, desktopNotification

### Fixed
- **XSS via innerHTML (pre-existing, hardened during refactor)** — Settings list renders for custom buttons / custom slash commands / file associations / slash menu concatenated user input directly into `innerHTML`. Added `escapeHtml()` helper and applied it at 5 injection points. DOM structure unchanged, string sanitization only.

### Internal
- Session schema (`sessions.json` keys and 6-field session object) unchanged — existing user sessions load transparently.
- Command IDs under `claudeCodeLauncher.*` preserved (legacy naming kept to protect existing `keybindings.json` bindings).
- `WebviewPanelSerializer` still not used — retained self-managed restore via `sessions.json` and activate-time `restoreSessions`.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Long paste truncation (recurrence)** — v2.4.0's `writePtyChunked` (1024B/10ms) still dropped bytes on Windows ConPTY under sustained writes, and concurrent `writePtyChunked` calls (paste + typing) could interleave chunks because each call started its own setTimeout chain. Now a per-entry write queue serializes all writes, chunk size dropped to 256B and delay bumped to 20ms for ConPTY buffer headroom, and chunk boundaries skip UTF-16 surrogate pair splits so emoji/astral chars don't corrupt.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Open File — Windows default app not launched** — Two issues combined silently: (1) `vscode.env.openExternal(Uri.file(...))` on Windows/Antigravity didn't hand off to the OS default app, and (2) when users had explicit `fileAssociations` like `.xlsx→excel`, the code invoked `spawn('excel', [...])` which fails with ENOENT since `excel` isn't in PATH. Both paths now route through `cmd.exe /c start "" "<path>"` (with `windowsVerbatimArguments` so `cmd` sees the quoted path intact), deferring to Windows file association to resolve the default app. Added a spawn error listener so future failures surface as a warning toast instead of silent.
- **Open File — partial/mid-drag selection** — "Open File" now uses the same `resolvePathFragment` recovery as Open Folder (cwd → ancestors → home dir → platform roots), so mid-drag fragments like `Downloads\foo.xlsx` resolve correctly. Previously only the basename-search fallback ran, which couldn't reach files outside `entry.cwd` (e.g. `~/Downloads`) and silently failed with "File not found".
- **`~` expansion for Open File** — `~`, `~/foo` now expand to the home directory.
- **Directory-as-file rejection** — If the resolved path points to a directory, Open File now warns instead of attempting to open it as a file.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Open Folder — partial/mid-drag selection** — Context menu "Open Folder" now correctly resolves partial paths (e.g., mid-drag of an absolute path selecting `rockuen/obsidian/...`). Introduced `resolvePathFragment` which tries cwd → ancestors (walk-up) → home dir → platform roots (`/Users` on Mac, `/home` on Linux), accepting only paths that actually exist. Previously walked up to any existing parent and silently opened the wrong folder (often cwd).
- **Open Folder — lost selection on right-click** — Some environments (notably Mac Electron + xterm canvas) cleared the selection during `mousedown`/`contextmenu`, causing "Select text first" toasts even with visible selection. Now caches the selection at `contextmenu` time and falls back to it when live selection is empty.
- **`~` expansion** — `~`, `~/foo` now expand to home directory on Mac/Linux.

### Added
- **Open Folder — success toast** — Shows "Open folder: <path>" on success (parity with Open File).
- **Invalid path warning** — Shows "Cannot open folder (invalid or partial path)" instead of silently opening an unrelated ancestor directory.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-08

### Security
- **Command injection hardening** — Replaced all `exec()` with `execFile`/`spawn` + argument arrays (`killPtyProcess`, `showDesktopNotification`, `handleOpenFile`, `handleOpenFolder`, `readClipboardImageFromSystem`)
- **URL scheme validation** — `open-link` handler now rejects non-http(s) URLs (prevents `javascript:`, `vscode:` execution)
- **Windows path injection fix** — `openNative` uses `vscode.env.openExternal` instead of `cmd /c start` for untrusted paths

### Fixed
- **Long text paste truncation** — `writePtyChunked()` splits large inputs into 1024-byte chunks with 10ms intervals (ConPTY buffer overflow fix)
- **Stale PTY handler race** — Added `entry.pty !== thisPty` guard on all `onData`/`onExit` handlers to prevent old PTY exit events from corrupting new PTY state
- **Restart PTY robustness** — Kill old PTY before spawn, reset `_disposed` flag, debounce with `_restarting` guard, use stored `cols/rows` instead of hardcoded 120x30
- **Deactivate saves dead sessions** — Filter `!entry.pty` entries to prevent restoring finished conversations on reload
- **Null PTY guards** — `handlePasteImage`, `handleDropFiles` now check `entry.pty` before write
- **File descriptor leak** — `_extractFirstUserMessage` uses `try/finally` for `fs.closeSync`
- **Particle animation** — Skip render loop when particles are disabled (CPU savings)
- **CLI resolve timeout** — `execFileSync` with 1.5s timeout (was `execSync` 3s blocking)

## [2.3.7] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **"Webview is disposed" errors** — Added `_disposed` guard flag and `try/catch` protection to all async `postMessage` calls (PTY `onExit`, `setTimeout` callbacks, clipboard `exec`). Cleared `runningDelayTimer` in `onDidDispose` to prevent stale timer firing.

## [2.3.6] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **Clean copy (trim trailing whitespace)** — `getCleanSelection()` trims trailing spaces from each line when copying terminal text. Applied to Ctrl+C, context menu Copy, Open File, and Open Folder.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Context usage parsing overhaul** — Comprehensive ANSI strip (CSI, OSC, 2-byte ESC, all control chars including CR/DEL), rolling 300-char buffer for cross-chunk pattern capture, optional colon in keyword regex (`컨텍스트:` format), broad fallback regex for resilient % detection

### Added
- **Inline group management icons** — Rename/Delete icons on custom group headers, Empty Trash icon on trash group header
- **Session group context values** — `customGroup` and `trashGroup` context values for precise menu targeting
- **Group rename command** — Rename groups with expanded state preservation
- **Debug logging** — One-time context buffer sample log for parsing diagnostics

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Custom session groups** — Unlimited user-defined groups, QuickPick session move, "Remove from Group" to ungroup
- **Trash / Restore** — Delete moves sessions to trash folder, Restore brings them back, Empty Trash with confirmation dialog
- **Group collapse state persistence** — `onDidExpandElement`/`onDidCollapseElement` tracking, restored on refresh
- **i18n nls files** — `package.nls.json` (English) + `package.nls.ko.json` (Korean) for sidebar labels

### Fixed
- **`const projDir` duplicate declaration** — Reused variable in `_buildGroups()` for Trash group

## [2.1.6] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **CLI resolution for npm installs** — Fixed "Cannot create process, error code 2" on Windows when Claude CLI is installed via `npm install -g`. node-pty cannot execute `.cmd` shim files directly; now wraps with `cmd.exe /c` automatically.
- Unified CLI path resolution into `resolveClaudeCli()` function (3-step: `~/.local/bin` → npm global → PATH fallback)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **i18n support** — English and Korean, auto-detected from IDE language setting
- **Settings modal** — In-extension settings UI (gear icon / right-click menu)
  - Theme, font size, font family, sound, particles toggle
  - Custom buttons and slash commands management
  - Export/Import settings as JSON for sharing
- **Context usage indicator** — Toolbar progress bar showing token usage (click to refresh)
- **Custom slash commands** — User-defined commands in autocomplete dropdown via settings
- **Custom buttons** — Configurable input panel buttons via settings
- **Ctrl+C copy** — Copy selected text with Ctrl+C, send interrupt when no selection
- **CLI not found detection** — Shows install guide when Claude Code CLI is missing

### Changed
- Toolbar simplified — removed zoom, paste image, sound buttons (accessible via settings/shortcuts)
- Queue button unified — single button for add + run
- Slash commands genericized — standard CLI commands only, personal skills via custom settings
